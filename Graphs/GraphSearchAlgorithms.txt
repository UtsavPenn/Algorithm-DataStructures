DFS - Every node asks its children if it has a path to the destination .
A number of recursive calls are made until the entire depth is traversed and hence it is called DFS.

Depth First Search for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree.
The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again.
To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array.


Applications - Finding Path, Topological Sorting, Detecting Cycles in a graph


BFS - Every node goes to its neighbors before going deep. A queue is used here . For every node , check if
its the final node , if not then queue up its children to the back of the queue. Ii is recommended for finding
shortest path.

Applications - Shortest Path, Peer to Peer Networks, Crawlers or Search Engines, Social Networking Websites



Connected Graph
A graph is connected if any two vertices of the graph are connected by a path.

Disconnected Graph
A graph is disconnected if at least two vertices of the graph are not connected by a path. If a graph G is
 disconnected, then every maximal connected subgraph of G is called a connected component of the graph G.
